Recipes Website Project
I will be making a basic Recipes Website with HTML.
I will be using my knowledge of elements and atributes for html code.
I will also incorporate clickable absolute and relative links along with images on the site.
No CSS will be in this project for now.
After finishing:
Once i completed the first recipe page it became simple to make the other pages. I already had a foundation to work off of and made it go much quicker. I did not ad any absolute links but many relative links
Cant wait to come back to the project and make it more FLASHY!
